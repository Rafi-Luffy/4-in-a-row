## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19+
- curl (for testing)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for full features)

### Instant Start (No Docker Required)
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Start the game immediately
./scripts/start-simple.sh
```

### Play the Game
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

### Test Everything
``
### ripts/test.sh
```

### Full Setup (with Database & Analytics)
```bash
# Full setup with PostgreSQL and Kafka
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/start.sh
```

### Manual Setup

1. Simple Mode (No dependencies):
```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

2. Full Mode (with Docker):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
cd backend && go run main.go
cd analytics && go run main.go
```

3. Access the Game: http://localhost:8080

## How to Play

1. Enter your username
2. Wait for opponent or play against bot (10s timeout)
3. Drop discs by clicking columns
4. First to connect 4 wins!
5. Check leaderboard for rankings

## Bot Intelligence

The bot uses strategic algorithms:
- Immediate threat detection: Blocks player wins
- Opportunity creation: Seeks winning moves
- Center preference: Controls board center
- Trap setup: Creates multiple winning paths

## Analytics

Kafka tracks:
- Game events (start, move, end)
- Player metrics (wins, games played)
- Performance data (game duration, moves)

## Leaderboard

Real-time rankings based on:
- Total wins
- Win percentage
- Games played

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8080)
- `DB_URL`: PostgreSQL connection
- `KAFKA_BROKERS`: Kafka broker addresses

## Production Ready

- Graceful shutdowns
- Error handling
- Connection pooling
- Event-driven architecture
- Scalable design

## API Endpoints

### REST API
- `GET /api/leadereSQL connectioop players ranking
- `GET /api/stats` - Get game statistics and metrics

### WebSocket Events
- `join_game` - Join matchmaking queue
- `make_move` - Make a game move
- `reconnect` - Reconnect to existing game

## Frontend Features
